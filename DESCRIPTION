Description: Provides graph-constrained regression methods in which
    regularization parameters are selected automatically via estimation of
    equivalent Linear Mixed Model formulation. 'riPEER' (ridgified Partially
    Empirical Eigenvectors for Regression) method employs a penalty term being
    a linear combination of graph-originated and ridge-originated penalty terms,
    whose two regularization parameters are ML estimators from corresponding
    Linear Mixed Model solution; a graph-originated penalty term allows imposing
    similarity between coefficients based on graph information given whereas
    additional ridge-originated penalty term facilitates parameters estimation:
    it reduces computational issues arising from singularity in a graph-originated
    penalty matrix and yields plausible results in situations when graph information
    is not informative. 'riPEERc' (ridgified Partially Empirical Eigenvectors
    for Regression with constant) method utilizes addition of a diagonal matrix
    multiplied by a predefined (small) scalar to handle the non-invertibility of
    a graph Laplacian matrix. 'vrPEER' (variable reducted PEER) method performs
    variable-reduction procedure to handle the non-invertibility of a graph
    Laplacian matrix.
